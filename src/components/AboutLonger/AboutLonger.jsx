      <p>
        I write clean and well-structured code, following best practices. I have a strong understanding of component-based
        architecture in React, separating logic from styles using styled-components. I implement state management and dynamic data
        operations (CRUD: create, edit, delete). I develop user authentication, profile editing, and comment systems.
