        I am an ambitious frontend developer with a good understanding of React, JavaScript, and UX/UI. I can create modern,
        scalable, and testable applications. My experience includes both individual projects and teamwork in an Agile environment. I
        am continuing my developing skills, especially in TypeScript and advanced React techniques.
